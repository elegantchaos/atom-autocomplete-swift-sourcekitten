# atom-autocomplete-swift-sourcekitten

An autocomplete provider for Atom, which provides Swift completions, using SourceKitten.

This is intended to be as light-weight as possible, and the primary objective is that it should work on Linux.

It requires SourceKitten to be installed on your system, and of course a swift toolchain, but nothing else.
